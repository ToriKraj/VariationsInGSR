# Variations In GSR
Variations in GSR is a generative multimedia experience created utilizing an Arduino Uno, Grove Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) Sensor, Max, and Ableton Live (unfortunately Ableton project files cannot be uploaded to git, but it was only used for its midi library to import better sounds into Max). The GSR sensor can detect changes in emotion based on sweat excretion that changes your skin resistance. The music and visuals in the max patch respond to these changes.
